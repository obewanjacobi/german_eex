# EEX German Power Market Project

This project is for my application to Genscape, a company in Louisville KY. My goal in this project is to understand the data and write up my findings. All of my work will be done in RStudio, and my write up will be done in RMarkdown to present any code that I have used. The data used in this repository will be in the zip file given to me labeled Datafiles.zip.
